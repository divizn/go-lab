GO-LAB

Go-Lab is a personal playground for experimenting with Go. It contains small projects, utilities, and experiments that explore different features of the language, including web servers, CLI tools, file handling, and more.

Project Structure
-----------------
- cmd/        : Entry points for different binaries (webserver, CLI tools, etc.)
- pkg/        : Reusable packages and utilities shared across binaries)
- .air.toml   : Air configuration for live reload during development
- run_air.sh  : Script to run Air with a specific target binary
- Makefile    : Convenient commands for building and running binaries
- .gitignore  : Files and directories ignored by Git

Getting Started
---------------
Run `make help` to see available commands for building and running binaries.

Notes
-----
- The project is intended for learning and experimenting â€” not production use.
- Contributions are welcome if they improve experiments or add interesting Go features.
